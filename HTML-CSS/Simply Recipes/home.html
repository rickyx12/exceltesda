		Hello and welcome to Simply Recipes
	</h2>
	<p>
		If you are unfamiliar with Simply Recipes, please allow me to take a moment to introduce you to the site. The first thing you should know is that Simply Recipes is a blog or a personal website, created and maintained by me, Elise Bauer.
		Unlike most of the large recipe sites that you might find on the Internet with tens of thousands of recipes, Simply Recipes is my personal website. The recipes are all tested (often several times) by me, my family or my friends.
