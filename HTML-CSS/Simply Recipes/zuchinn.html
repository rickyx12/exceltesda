		<h3>Method</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Salt the grated zucchini with about 1 teaspoon of salt. Place in a sieve or colander over a bowl. Let sit for 10 minutes. Press down with a wooden spoon to push out more of the water. Wrap in paper towels and try to squeeze out more liquid.zucchini-fritters-method-1

			While the zucchini is releasing its liquid in step one, make the dipping sauce. Whisk together the sour cream, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt into a medium bowl and set aside.

			Heat oil in a large skillet (we recommend a 10-inch cast iron skillet) over medium high heat until the oil is shimmery and hot. Test the oil by flicking a little flour into it. If the flour sizzles it's ready. Cook the fritters in batches. Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the skillet. Flatten slightly with the back end of a spoon or spatula. Cook, turning once, until browned, 4-6 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining batter.zucchini-fritters-method-3 zucchini-fritters-method-4
			Serve immediately, with sour cream dipping sauce.
			Fritters can be reheated by placing on a sheet pan under a broiler for a minute or two.
